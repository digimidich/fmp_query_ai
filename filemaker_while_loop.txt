# FileMaker While Loop Examples

## Basic While Loop Structure

```
# Initialize counter
Set Variable [ $counter ; Value: 1 ]

# While loop with condition
While [ $counter ≤ 10 ]
    # Loop body - do something here
    Show Custom Dialog [ "Iteration: " & $counter ]
    
    # Increment counter (IMPORTANT: prevents infinite loop)
    Set Variable [ $counter ; Value: $counter + 1 ]
End While
```

## Practical Example: Process Records

```
# Initialize variables
Set Variable [ $recordCount ; Value: Get ( FoundCount ) ]
Set Variable [ $currentRecord ; Value: 1 ]

# While loop to process each record
While [ $currentRecord ≤ $recordCount ]
    # Go to the current record
    Go to Record/Request/Page [ $currentRecord ]
    
    # Do something with the current record
    # For example: update a field
    Set Field [ Table::ProcessedField ; "Processed on " & Get ( CurrentTime ) ]
    
    # Move to next record
    Set Variable [ $currentRecord ; Value: $currentRecord + 1 ]
End While
```

## Example: Search and Replace in Loop

```
# Initialize variables
Set Variable [ $searchText ; Value: "old text" ]
Set Variable [ $replaceText ; Value: "new text" ]
Set Variable [ $currentRecord ; Value: 1 ]
Set Variable [ $totalRecords ; Value: Get ( FoundCount ) ]

# While loop for search and replace
While [ $currentRecord ≤ $totalRecords ]
    # Go to current record
    Go to Record/Request/Page [ $currentRecord ]
    
    # Check if field contains search text
    If [ PatternCount ( Table::TextField ; $searchText ) > 0 ]
        # Replace the text
        Set Field [ Table::TextField ; Substitute ( Table::TextField ; $searchText ; $replaceText ) ]
    End If
    
    # Move to next record
    Set Variable [ $currentRecord ; Value: $currentRecord + 1 ]
End While
```

## Important Notes:

1. **Always initialize your counter variable** before the loop
2. **Always increment your counter** inside the loop to prevent infinite loops
3. **Use meaningful variable names** for clarity
4. **Test your condition carefully** to ensure the loop will terminate
5. **Consider using Exit Loop If** for early termination if needed

## Early Exit Example:

```
Set Variable [ $counter ; Value: 1 ]

While [ $counter ≤ 100 ]
    # Do some processing
    Set Field [ Table::Status ; "Processing..." ]
    
    # Exit early if condition is met
    Exit Loop If [ Table::Status = "Complete" ]
    
    Set Variable [ $counter ; Value: $counter + 1 ]
End While
```
